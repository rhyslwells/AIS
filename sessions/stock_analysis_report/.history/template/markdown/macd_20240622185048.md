### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

**Description:** This plot shows the MACD line, MACD signal line, and MACD histogram (the difference between the two lines). The plot is designed to help:
   - Visualize the relationship between two moving averages.
   - Identify potential trading signals derived from MACD crossovers and divergence patterns.
   - Monitor the histogram for changes in momentum.

**What to Look For:**

1. **MACD Line and Signal Line Crossovers:**
   - **Bullish Crossover:** When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it suggests a potential buy signal.
   - **Bearish Crossover:** When the MACD line crosses below the signal line, it suggests a potential sell signal.

2. **MACD Histogram:**
   - **Positive Histogram:** Indicates the MACD line is above the signal line, suggesting bullish momentum.
   - **Negative Histogram:** Indicates the MACD line is below the signal line, suggesting bearish momentum.
   - **Histogram Peaks and Troughs:** Changes in the height of the histogram can indicate the strength of the momentum. For example, a decreasing positive histogram might indicate weakening bullish momentum.

3. **Divergence Patterns:**
   - **Bullish Divergence:** When the price makes lower lows but the MACD makes higher lows, it suggests a potential reversal to the upside.
   - **Bearish Divergence:** When the price makes higher highs but the MACD makes lower highs, it suggests a potential reversal to the downside.

4. **MACD Line Crossing Zero:**
   - **Crossing Above Zero:** Indicates the start of a bullish trend.
   - **Crossing Below Zero:** Indicates the start of a bearish trend.
