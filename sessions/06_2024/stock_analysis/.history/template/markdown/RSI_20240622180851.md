### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

**Description:** This function computes and plots the RSI (Relative Strength Index) using the `RSIIndicator` class from the `ta.momentum` module. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The plot includes horizontal lines at RSI levels of 70 (overbought) and 30 (oversold) to indicate potential reversal zones. This visualization helps traders:
- Identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market.
- Predict potential trend reversals based on RSI signals.

**What to Look For:**

1. **RSI Levels:**
   - **Above 70 (Overbought):** Indicates that the stock may be overbought, suggesting a potential sell signal or trend reversal.
   - **Below 30 (Oversold):** Indicates that the stock may be oversold, suggesting a potential buy signal or trend reversal.

2. **RSI Divergence:**
   - **Bullish Divergence:** When the stock price makes a new low but the RSI makes a higher low, it can indicate a potential upward reversal.
   - **Bearish Divergence:** When the stock price makes a new high but the RSI makes a lower high, it can indicate a potential downward reversal.

3. **RSI Crossovers:**
   - **Crossing Above 30:** Can indicate a bullish signal, suggesting the stock is exiting oversold conditions.
   - **Crossing Below 70:** Can indicate a bearish signal, suggesting the stock is exiting overbought conditions.

4. **RSI Trends:**
