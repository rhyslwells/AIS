- [ ] Modularise (app: generate_markdown_report) creation function to allow optional parameters.

### Done:

- [X] Fix Close price to adjusted price
- [X] Clean markdown notes to standard format
- [X] edit markdown printer in app.py so that it shows images.
- [X] Edit user input to allow for the options to show specific outputs (e.g. only macd and rsi)
