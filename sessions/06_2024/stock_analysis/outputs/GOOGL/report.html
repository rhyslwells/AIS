new low but the RSI makes a higher low, it can indicate a potential
upward reversal.</li>
<li><strong>Bearish Divergence:</strong> When the stock price makes a
new high but the RSI makes a lower high, it can indicate a potential
downward reversal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>RSI Crossovers:</strong>
<ul>

activity and potential price movement.</li>

trend, as increased selling drives the price down.</li>
<li><strong>Low Volume with Price Movement:</strong> Suggests a lack of
conviction behind the price movement, which may not be sustainable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Volume as Confirmation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support and Resistance Levels:</strong> Volume can confirm
breakouts or breakdowns at key price levels. Higher volume at these
levels strengthens the validity of the breakout or breakdown.</li>

precede or confirm trend reversals.</li>
