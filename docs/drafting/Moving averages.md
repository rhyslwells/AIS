- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: A type of moving average that gives more weight to recent prices.
## Usage

- Identifying trends in stock prices

### Code Example

python

Copy code

``` python
	import pandas as pd
	import yfinance as yf
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	
	# Download stock data
	data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2021-01-01')
	
	# Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA)
	data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
