# Amateur investing seminar (AIS)

AIS is a monthly meetup, where we discuss investment strategies.
The repository contains resources and documentation for the sessions.
All resources here are for personal use only.

# Session structure

Depending on the skills of the group each session may involve:

- **Presentation:** Introduce key concepts and techniques for analyzing stocks.
- **Hands-on Exercises:** Analysis through a jupyter notebook for participants to follow along.
- **Resource Sharing:** Exploring interesting tools/videos/blog posts.
- **Project Work:** Exploring avenues of interest.

# Schedule

There is a rough proposed schedule for the sessions at [schedule](docs\schedule.md).
However we are flexible and can change the schedule based on the needs of the group.
