# Amateur investing seminar (AIS)

AIS is a monthly meetup, where we discuss investment strategies.
The repository contains resources and documentation for the sessions.
All resources here are for personal use only.

Depending on the skills of the group each session may involve:

- **Presentation:** Introduce key concepts and techniques for analyzing stocks.
- **Hands-on Exercises:** Analysis through a jupyter notebook for participants to follow along.
- **Resource Sharing:** Exploring interesting tools/videos/blog posts.
- **Project Work:** Exploring avenues of interest.

# Schedule

There is a rough proposed schedule for the sessions at [[schedule]].
However we are flexible and can change the schedule based on the needs of the group.
